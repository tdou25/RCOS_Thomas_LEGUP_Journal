RCOS LEGUP Journal

7/23/24

The purpose of this repository is to retroactively create a journal of my learning process when joining LEGUP at the beginning of the semester, as well as to explain my lack of commits between the week of 6/4 (the day of small group meeting) and the mid-year commit summary.

Entries to this "journal" will take the form of plain-text files and will be titled in the following format:

	mm-dd-yy_Entry.txt
	

For any outside observers:

The Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) is an organization based out of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) committed to advancing the cause of open source by creating an environment where new open source projects can find collaborators and thrive. Students (such as myself) may take RCOS as a course, where they join an existing project (or create their own) and are graded on the quality of their contributions.

LEGUP is one such project. LEGUP (or Logic Engine for Grid-Using Puzzles) is the brain child of Dr. Bram van Heuveln, a professor of Cognitive Science here at RPI. LEGUP is a study tool for students in formal logic courses and is designed to introduce the notion and strengthen students' grasps of formal proofs, using grid-based puzzles as a medium.
