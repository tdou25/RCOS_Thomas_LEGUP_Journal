Entry 6/11/24

I mostly spent today trying to full understand what implementing the X-Wing rule would
entail withint he LEGUP framework for Sudoku.

There are some challenges inherent to LEGUP and its ability to support such "rules" or 
represent such techniques as rules.
One is how complex techniques like X-Wing should be implemented, as due to the DAG structure of
LEGUP proofs, one board state node can't in any capacity "access" information about another node.

See the 6/7 entry for more information on how X-Wing works, or watching this video:

There may be some workarounds:
- one might be implementing support for annotations.
- another may be implementing representing X-Wing in a weaker form. 

Each of these come with their own challenges (that, spoiler alert, prevent the support of X-Wing in LEGUP)
