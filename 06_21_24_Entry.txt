Entry 6/21/24

Today, I continued trying to implement the X-Wing rule (keyword: trying).

After examining the code and how the abstract rule classes are implemented, I've 
come to the conclusion that adding support for multiple transition selects would be 
too difficult and disruptive to the LEGUP backened to implement. 

It took the intervention of Dr. Bram himself to come to this conclusion, and I 
guess the customer is always right. 

I've decided to pivot to implementing the puzzle maker for Sudoku.
